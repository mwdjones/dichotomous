## Dichotomous Noise Models for Methane Production

This repository contains code for a numerical model used to analyze spikes in methane production from wetlands using a dichotomous noise model. 
Using this approach allows us to focus in on the effect that active water table dynamics have on methane capture and release. Rapid switching between oxic and anoxic
states across a threshold may create spikes in methane production.
